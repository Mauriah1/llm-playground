Susan Hengeveld, a longtime saw‑whet owl specialist at Indiana’s Yellowwood State Forest, spends each fall untangling and banding the tiny Northern Saw‑Whet Owls that migrate through the woods.  After years of training volunteers and students to place metal bands, record measurements, and log movements, she has built a long‑term dataset that now shows the species travels far farther and in more directions than once believed.  The data, collected by checking fine nets and audio lures each night, is crucial for spotting population trends and guiding conservation, and Hengeveld stresses that the continuity of the dataset is what makes it valuable.

The banding season is a hands‑on, night‑time operation.  Hengeveld, her husband Jim, and a mix of experienced volunteers and newcomers trek through pitch‑dark forest, listening for the faint “bark” calls of the owls while checking nets for captures.  When a bird is found, the delicate work of freeing it and fitting a band is passed to a novice—this ritual of hand‑holding the warm, feathered creature is meant to spark a personal connection to the science.  The story highlights the logistical challenges—dead hearing‑aid batteries, uncharged headlamps, and the need for precise timing—but also the quiet awe of watching a tiny owl take off into the black night.

Beyond the fieldwork, Susan’s journey began with a PhD on frog calls and evolved into a career studying birdsong and avian learning.  Her decades of teaching and research culminated in inheriting Indiana’s first band‑ing station in 2010, turning Yellowwood into a hub for saw‑whet research.  Now, with retirement on the horizon, she is focused on handing the torch to the next generation, ensuring that the painstakingly gathered data and the intimate experience of holding a live owl continue to inspire future biologists.
